Introduction
============

> The purpose of this exercise is to provide you with some initial
> practical experience of the sort of products that are obtained on
> vegetation fires and biomass burning from Earth orbiting satellites,
> and an overview of how these fit into the IPCC Greenhouse Gas (GHG)
> Inventory Process. If you do not complete this
> practical work in class you should ensure you go back and finish the
> rest in the coming days.
>
> **Learning objectives** are to gain an understanding of the process by
> which countries calculate and report their GHG emissions to the IPCC,
> and of some of the remotely sensed fire datasets that can be of use in
> these and other calculations.

By the end of this practical you should:
========================================

-   Understand the basis of the IPPCC process for estimating GHG
    emission from vegetation fires, and be able to use the basic
    spreadsheets involved in this calculation.

-   Understand the basics of Active Fire and Burned Area datasets and
    how they are derived from remote sensing observations, appreciating
    their main advantages and disadvantages

-   Use the Python / Jupyter examples to;

    -   Display image files

    -   Display vector files

    -   Display spreadsheet information

-   Be able to search and order various fire datasets from online
    sources, such as the Fire Information for Resource Management System
    (FIRMS;
