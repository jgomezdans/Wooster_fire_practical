Introduction
============

> The purpose of this exercise is to provide you with some 
> practical experience of the sort of products that are obtained on
> vegetation fires and biomass burning from Earth orbiting satellites,
> and an overview of how these fit into the IPCC Greenhouse Gas (GHG)
> Inventory Process. 


Learning outcomes
=================

-   Understand the basis of the IPPCC process for estimating GHG
    emission from vegetation fires, and be able to use the basic
    spreadsheets involved in this calculation.

-   Understand the basics of Active Fire and Burned Area datasets and
    how they are derived from remote sensing observations, appreciating
    their main advantages and disadvantages

-   Visualise active fire datasets and burned area datasets, and apply some
    simple processing to these (modifying supplied Python scripts)
